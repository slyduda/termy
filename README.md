# Termy

Termy is a fun and exciting word guessing game inspired by New York Time's puzzle game Wordle. Unlike Wordle, Termy utilizes a backend component that allows us to save your games to make backups and to aggragate fun stats to show you and your friends without collecting a single piece of personal information. Most importantly though, Termy is open source and forever free.
